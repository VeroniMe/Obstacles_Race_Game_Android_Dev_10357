This project is part of the Cellular Applications course at Afeka College (Course Code: 10357). The initial phase of the project focuses on developing an obstacle race game. 
## First Part
The first phase demonstrates the following features:
* Three-lane road
* Object (ufo) that can move left and right
* Obstacles (asteroids) on the road
* Driving at a constant speed on the road (obstacles come to you)
* Crash notification (Toast message + vibration)
* 3 lives (decrease when crashed)
* Endless game (3 lives after death) - for now.
